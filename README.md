This is my First practise program that involves:
1. Amazon RDS MySQL DB with one table and 5 records.
2. A Java code that connects to the above table to display the result.
3. A GitHub Action workflow that checks for vulnerability in code using TruffleHog and another workflow that builds the jar file using all artifacts.
4. Connect EC2 with RDS and display the results in an csv file format stored in S3 bucket.

Pending Actions:

1. Setup a self hosted github runner on EC2.
2. Deploy this jar file on a Amazon EC2 instance.
